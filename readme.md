Second project

----- Workshop -----


                   ***


This is a proposition of a any workshop's website. 
This website is to test of a my skills in create diferent websites. 


                   ***

At the moment, the site has little information.
At now it is: 
- structure of site 
- header 
- navigation (menu)

In future I would like to oscilate buttons, finish every section in css and do (in future better) animation's website.
